# Next-gen auth client implementation guide

a.k.a. How to implement next-gen auth in your Matrix client

> n.b. The plan is that this document will become a doc on matrix.org. Please feel free to make edits/comments/suggestions etc.

When implementing an next-gen auth client you can test against the [OIDC Playground](https://github.com/element-hq/oidc-playground) where a number of Homeservers are available in different configurations.

This is covering the Authorization Code Grant flow. To learn about the Device Code Grant flow, see [Device code grant](./device-code-grant/).

# Useful terminology

- OAuth 2.0 is a set of specifications defined in RFCs by the IETF
- OpenID Connect is an identity layer on top of OAuth 2.0 specs
- Authorisation server is the server implementing the OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect server capabilities. In our case, this is effectively the Homeserver
- Issuer is the canonical name and URL of an authorisation server in the OpenID Connect specification
- Relying party is the party requesting authorisation. In our case, this is effectively the client
- Authorisation server metadata is a set of key/values parameters associated with the authorisation server
- Client metadata is a set of key/values parameters associated with the client

# Sample flow

## Discovery [MSC2965]

To interact with the OAuth 2.0/OIDC APIs of the homeserver, the client first has to discover the authorisation server metadata.
This is defined by [MSC2965] and works as follow:

 - determine the issuer through a new Matrix C-S API
 - get the server metadata through OpenID Connect Discovery


<CsApiInput client:load />

To first determine the issuer, we must fetch the new `GET /auth_issuer` endpoint.
In out case, that will be <code><AuthIssuerEndpoint client:load /></code>

<AuthIssuerFetcher client:load />

Now that we have our issuer (<code><CurrentIssuer client:load /></code>), we can fetch the OIDC Discovery Document, at <code><OidcDiscoveryDocument client:load /></code>

<OidcMetadataFetcher client:load />

## Client registration [MSC2966]

We know everything about the server, let's tell them about us now, by sending out set of **client metadata** values.
This includes things like the name of the client, the logo, redirect URI, etc.
Have a go and customise a few things!

<ClientMetadataForm grantTypes={["authorization_code", "refresh_token"]} client:load />

The client is now registered with the client ID <code><CurrentClientId client:load /></code>

## Authorization request [MSC2964]

We are almost ready to start an authentication flow.
We still need to gather the a few parameters that will be used to start the flow.

This includes the `state` parameter, which is a random string that will be useful to distinguish between different authentication requests.
It also includes the `code_challenge` parameter, which is derived from a random string called the `code_verifier`.

<AuthParametersForm client:load />

Putting it all together, we can now start the authentication flow.

<DisplayAuthorizationUrl client:load />

Once the authorization is complete, you'll get a `code` back, which you can paste bellow and exchange.

<CodeExchangeForm client:load />

This gave us an access token, which we can now use to make authenticated requests to the homeserver.

## Refresh token [MSC2964]

The access token (<code><CurrentAccessToken client:load /></code>) is only valid for a short period of time.
It must be refreshed before it expires.

<RefreshTokenForm client:load />
