# Using the Device Code Grant

The Device Code Grant is a type of OAuth 2.0 grant that is used in contexts where opening the user's browser is not possible or desirable.

# Sample flow

## Discovery [MSC2965]

To interact with the OAuth 2.0/OIDC APIs of the homeserver, the client first has to discover the authorisation server metadata.
[MSC2965] defines a new Matrix C-S API to do just that.

<CsApiInput client:load />

To get the server metadata, we must fetch the new `GET /auth_metadata` endpoint.
In out case, that will be <code><AuthMetadataEndpoint client:load /></code>

<AuthMetadataFetcher client:load />

## Client registration [MSC2966]

We know everything about the server, let's tell them about us now, by sending out set of **client metadata** values.
This includes things like the name of the client, the logo, redirect URI, etc.
Have a go and customise a few things!

Because we would like to use the Device Code Grant, we need to add the `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code` grant type to the list of requested grant types.

<ClientMetadataForm grantTypes={["urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code", "refresh_token"]} client:load />

The client is now registered with the client ID <code><CurrentClientId client:load /></code>

## Device authorisation request [RFC8628]

We are ready to start the authentication process.
To do so, we will start a session by sending a request to the device authorization endpoint.

<DeviceCodeRequestForm client:load />

This gave us three values:

 - A `device_code`, which we will need to exchange for an access token
 - A `user_code`, which we will display to the user for them to enter
 - A `verification_uri`, which we will ask the user to visit to complete the flow

<DeviceCodeQrCode client:load />

## Token request [RFC8628]

In the background, the client must now poll the token endpoint to exchange the device code for an access token.

To do so, we will send a request to the token endpoint, with the following parameters:

 - `grant_type` set to `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code`
 - `device_code` set to the device code we received from the device authorization endpoint
 - `client_id` set to the client ID we registered

<DeviceCodeExchangeForm client:load />

This gave us an access token, which we can now use to make authenticated requests to the homeserver.

## Refresh token [MSC2964]

The access token (<code><CurrentAccessToken client:load /></code>) is only valid for a short period of time.
It must be refreshed before it expires.

<RefreshTokenForm client:load />
