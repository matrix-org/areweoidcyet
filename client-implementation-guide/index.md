# Matrix client OIDC implementation guide

a.k.a. How to make your Matrix client OIDC-native

> n.b. The plan is that this document will become a doc on matrix.org. Please feel free to make edits/comments/suggestions etc.

If you only want to make the client [OIDC-aware as per MSC3824](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3824) then see the [client requirements section](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/hughns/sso-redirect-action/proposals/3824-oidc-aware-clients.md#definition-of-oidc-aware) of the MSC.

When implementing an OIDC-native client you can test against the [OIDC Playground](https://github.com/vector-im/oidc-playground) where a number of Homeservers are available in different configurations.

# Useful terminology

- OpenID Connect (OIDC) - the protocol being used to authenticate a user and acquire an access token to use with a homeserver
- OpenID Provider (OP) - the OIDC compatible server that is capable of issuing access tokens
- Issuer - the OP that is being used to issue access tokens for a particular homeserver

# Requirements

## Discovery and client registration

There are two steps to get started:

1. Discovery - determining which OP is being used by a Homeserver to issue access tokens (or if OIDC is not supported)
2. Client registration - obtaining a client_id [+ client_secret] to use when interacting with the OP

**Discovery**

To determine whether a Homeserver is using auth delegated via OIDC you make use of [MSC2965](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2965) and check the `/.well-known/matrix/client`. The presence of org.matrix.msc2965.authentication indicates that homeserver is using OIDC.

e.g. from [https://synapse-oidc.lab.element.dev/.well-known/matrix/client](https://synapse-oidc.lab.element.dev/.well-known/matrix/client)

```
{
¬†¬†"m.homeserver": {
¬†¬†¬†¬†"base_url": "https://synapse-oidc.lab.element.dev/"
  },
¬†¬†"org.matrix.msc2965.authentication": {
¬†¬†¬†¬†"issuer": "https://auth-oidc.lab.element.dev/",
¬†¬†¬†¬†"account": "https://auth-oidc.lab.element.dev/account"
¬†¬†}
}
```

**Client registration**

Unless your client has been statically registered with the OpenID Provider you will need to make use of what is known as ‚Äúdynamic client registration‚Äù. This is described in [MSC2966](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2966) which makes use of [RFC7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591).

It is not always that case that an OP will support dynamic client registration. If this is the case and the client doesn‚Äôt already know of a static client_id then you make an HTTP request against the OP passing metadata to 

The client registration is currently implemented on a per-device basis. The client should store the client ID it is assigned (mapped to the specific homeserver) as this will be needed when refreshing tokens.

> **A note on dynamic client registration:**
> If you have used OIDC for auth in an app previously then you may be surprised to see that the client needs to be dynamically registered instead of statically.
> This is due to the open nature of the Matrix eco-system where by default any client can be used to connect to any HS.
> In the legacy (non-OIDC) architecture it is implicit that any client can connect to any HS, whereas in OIDC architecture it becomes explicit: each client either needs to be pre-registered with a HS/OP or the HS/OP allows clients to dynamically register.

**Recommended flow**

Here are the recommended flows depending on whether your client also supports ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù (non-OIDC) auth:

![Discovery with legacy fallback](./discovery%20with%20fallback.png)

![Discovery without legacy fallback](./discovery%20without%20fallback.png)

## User Login and User Registration

This is a typical OAuth/OIDC login flow. [PKCE](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7636.html) is mandated in order to address some attacks.

One notable change from before is that you need to generate a device ID yourself whereas with legacy auth the Homeserver would create a device ID for you if you didn‚Äôt specify one.

Once you have generated the device ID (e.g. `ABCDEFGHIJKL`) you then use it in the scope parameter of the request.

There are three scopes that you need to request access to:

- `openid` - standard OIDC scope 
- `urn:matrix:org.matrix.msc2967.client:api:*` - gives full access to Client Server API. See [MSC2967: API scopes](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2967) for details of future scopes
- `urn:matrix:org.matrix.msc2967.client:device:<generated device ID>` - e.g. `urn:matrix:org.matrix.msc2967.client:device:ABCDEFGHIJKL`

So, a complete scope would be:

`openid urn:matrix:org.matrix.msc2967.client:api:* urn:matrix:org.matrix.msc2967.client:device:ABCDEFGHIJKL`

You can use the `prompt=create` to indicate that this is a new user registration.

An example from a hydrogen running on localhost is: (whitespace added just for readability)

```
GET¬†/auth?
  response_mode=fragment&
  response_type=code&
  redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A3000&
  client_id=hydrogen-oidc-playground&
  state=MaH7aaDB&
  scope=openid+urn%3Amatrix%3Aorg.matrix.msc2967.client%3Aapi%3A*+urn%3Amatrix%3Aorg.matrix.msc2967.client%3Adevice%3AjtiAHHIr1T&
  nonce=A2Iat6Y2&
  code_challenge_method=S256&
  code_challenge=d9UAwn-QGjq6wp-hVfu2INVpFiZ5kQih4hYpoRPoPFk
```

## Access token handling

The most important point to understand here is that the OpenID Provider is now responsible for issuing tokens and the homeserver isn‚Äôt involved in this process anymore.

Additionally access tokens must be issued with an expiration date, and so token refresh handling is a requirement of the implementation too.

## Logout

[RFC7009 Token Revocation](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7009) is used which is pretty straightforward.

## UIA/re-auth for sensitive API calls

This isn‚Äôt fully defined/implemented yet.

## Account management

TODO
